# self assign role discord bot
 Discord bot which allows users to self assign roles. The bot sends a message into a selected discord text channel, stating the roles which can be self assigned and each role is assosiated with an emoji. The users can react to the bot's message with the assosiated emoji and the bot will assign that user the role. Users can also remove the emoji to get the role removed. 

# Purpose
I own a discord server which I use to speak to my friends. There are multiple text channels where the subjects of the text channels vary . Not all the users on the server are interested in all subjects. Therefore I had an idea to make a bot which would allow users to assign themselves roles which would allow them to see the roles assosiated text channel. 

For example if I had a role called "Football" and a text channel called "Football" as well. Only users with the role "Football" can view the text channel "Football". This stops users who arent interested in football getting notifications from the channel by default. If a user wants to join the "Football" channel then they can use the bot.

# Additional Commands
+ ping - This makes the bot respond with "Pong"
+ role <add/remove> \<role name\> - Bot adds or removes role from user
